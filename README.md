CPU Scheduling Simulator

A full-stack CPU Scheduling Simulator that visualizes and executes multiple CPU scheduling algorithms.  
This project helps understand how different scheduling strategies work by simulating process execution and generating results such as waiting time, turnaround time, and Gantt charts.
